# pt-oled-sys
Update to O-LED menu for pi-top

Disclaimer:

I'm not the original developer of this code. I have reverse engineered it to open more features and simply to make some tweaks and bring it "up to date." This code is as-is and implies no waranty. 

An excellent write up about how everything works is at this link:

To install, just copy the components folder into `/usr/lib/pt-sys-oled` and overwrite the files. Alternatively, as of right now, the only updates are to the `widgets` folder and `Menu.py` within the `components` directly. Copy this folder and file into the associated directory and enjoy.
